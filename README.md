2004licious theme for Shaarli
=============================

This [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/shaarli) theme is a humble homage to the early looks of the 
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) site.

Created by Joshua Schachter, [del.icio.us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) is one of the 
monuments of early Web 2.0 socially-oriented platforms. The [original del.icio.us layout](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joshu/albums/72157600740166824/), 
with its naked but smart HTML look, is a fond memory of the earlier web days. This theme tries its best to 
recreate that feeling.

Installation
------------
The master branch of this 2004licious theme works with the latest version of Shaarli (v0.14 at the time of this 
writing).

Just clone or download this repository into the `tpl/` folder of your Shaaril installation then go in the 
`Tools/Configure` menu to activate this theme.

This theme relies partially on the `default` theme. So be sure to keep that available in your `tpl/` folder too.

Enjoy and don't hesitate to report bugs or suggest changes.

What to expect
--------------
This is not a professionally looking theme with all features that the official Shaarli theme proposes.
It’s more a hacked together set of files to achieve a certain look. Compromises have been done to have the basic
features work. But it’ll certainly feel more like the web from 2004 than 2024. Mainly the link lists and the edit 
link pages have been tweaked; the CSS changes made some of the other pages (such as Tools) look pretty off. 
It’s a constant work in progress and if you are motivated, feel free to join us by submitting issues or code.

History of this project
-----------------------
At Manufactura Independiente, both of us were early users of the del.icio.us service, and used it during our 
college days and beyond to make sense of our web pathways.

[Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) was also an active user of del.icio.us until he switched to 
[Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/shaarli) in 2012.

Around 2016, the then owner of the del.icio.us brand starting injecting ads in the feeds of the long gone users 
of the service. This triggered a discussion between Julien and Ricardo about reviving the old Delicious look on 
top of a Shaarli instance. Ricardo made the most out of a slow Sunday to try his hand at creating a Shaarli 
theme -- emulating the 2004 look.

Authorship and development is shared with Julien Deswaef, who has been active improving the theme and making it 
work with recent versions of Shaarli.
